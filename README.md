## Professional Focus

I design machine learning systems with an emphasis on:

- Validation integrity  
- Data leakage prevention  
- Imbalanced classification handling  
- Threshold calibration  
- Risk-aware evaluation  

My approach prioritizes deployment-relevant performance over headline metrics.

## Selected Projects

### Credit Card Fraud Detection System

Designed an end-to-end fraud detection framework on highly imbalanced data (0.17% positive class).

Key engineering decisions:
- Strict train-test separation to prevent leakage
- Stratified cross-validation
- SMOTE vs class-weight comparison
- ROC-based threshold optimization
- Recall vs false-positive trade-off analysis

Result: ROC-AUC 0.987 with calibrated decision boundary.

- Feature preprocessing with ColumnTransformer
- Cross-validated model comparison
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Performance benchmarking

Result: R² 0.833
